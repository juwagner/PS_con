# PS_con: Shape-Constrained Penalized Splines
Penalized splines is a popular method for function estimation under the assumption of smoothness.
The provided code extends the well known P-spline method to constraints on its shape, such as monotonicity or convexity, and allows for the consideration of additional random effects within the model.
